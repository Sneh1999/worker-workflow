The complaints and reviews would come in and the product manager would tell us what it was he knew needed to be fixed and I communicated back how well and fast it could have been done. Things usually went fairly smoothly and I seemed to be moving at a panicked rate so they had me moved to another team that was making an app that was entirely different from the initial one. It was an unexpected experience to chase after an experience of learning and craving harder challenges without being frustrated and/or bored by getting stuck or doing things slowly. It was a good learning experience for my own growth and that's why it was great.,Yes,Yes,25,Pitstop,Mobile Intern,8,"The interview went like usual, the interviewer would ask me a couple of questions about what they expected me to have some experience with and gaged how well I was to be a positive addition to the team. I answered most of the questions well because this team was relatively inexperienced due to the interviewer being a recent graduate and having only picked up a few more years of experience but still having more in terms applying it all from the ground up. I felt like I could learn but for the most part was worried about getting a job at all.",5,"I really did not like this experience because the whole time I was expecting to make great leaps in terms of product features, but it was just constant UI changes and adding support for the app to fix bugs rather than to add features. I wasn't aware that there was even an issue that the app might have needed a push for new ideas or something to properly push it towards customers rather than try to do what it was doing better than before. It wasn't until the near end that the team figured out that there needed to be some deliberation on what the app needed to be and what the stars of the product needed to be and how good they had to be.

I returned to work on the mobile apps again and everything was similar except for the work environment because I was moved to a separate floor and office from the main team. It wasn't really an issue but it did make it hard for me to converse with anyone and I was often very tired from trying to find something to make the term shine better than it did before since I could not get an outstanding on my review.

I was later contacted several times by HR and my manager to follow-up, ask more questions, and make sure I was still on board.",9,"Overall, very useful experience in the automotive industry. My mentor was committed to my development, which helped me engage more with my work.

This is especially frustrating when you're trying to read a job description, then try to apply and it logs out. The whole ""open new tab"" option should just be able to be done with keyboard/mouse shortcuts (that every other site uses). Salary should be visible as one of the descriptors, so its easy to identify which ones are high paying, avg, or unpaid.
